        <p>Millions of people use Google search every day for a variety of reasons. Students use it for school,
            business people use it for research, and millions more use it for entertainment.
            But most people may not be using Google search to its full potential.</p>

            <h3>Here are few Google search tips and tricks to maximize your search efficiency:</h3>

            <h2>Use the tabs</h2>
            <p>The first tip is to use the tabs in Google search. On the top of every search are a number of tabs.
                Usually you’ll see Web, Image, News, and More. Using these tabs, you can help define what kind of search
                you need to do.</p>

            <h2>Use quotes</h2>
            <p>When searching for something specific, try using quotes to minimize the guesswork for Google search. When
                you put your search parameters in quotes, it tells the search engine to search for the whole phrase.</p>

            <h2>Use a hyphen to exclude words</h2>
            <p>Sometimes you may find yourself searching for a word with an ambiguous meaning. An example is Mustang.
                When you Google search for Mustang, you may get results for both the car made by Ford or the horse. If
                you want to cut one out, use the hyphen to tell the engine to ignore content with one of the other. See
                the example below.</p>
            <h5>Mustang -cars</h5>

            <h2>Use a colon to search specific sites</h2>
            <p>There may be an instance where you need to Google search for articles or content on a certain website.
                The syntax is very simple and we’ll show you below.</p>
            <h5>NBA site:nhl.com</h5>

            <h2>Use the asterisk wildcard</h2>
            <p>The asterisk wildcard is one of the most useful ones on the list. Here’s how it works.<br>
                When you use an asterisk in a search term on Google search, it will leave a placeholder that may be
                automatically filled by the search engine later. This is a brilliant way to find song lyrics if you
                don’t know all the words. Let’s look at the syntax:</p>
            <h5>“Come * right now * me”</h5>

            <h2>Find sites that are similar to other sites</h2>
            This is a unique one that could be used by practically everyone if they knew it existed.<br>

            Let’s say you have a favorite website. It can be anything. However, that website is getting a little bit
            boring and you want to find other websites like it. You would use this trick. Below is the syntax:
                <br>
            <h5>related:facebook.com</h5>

            <h2>Use Google search to do math</h2>
            <p>Google search can actually do math for you. This is a rather complex one to describe because it can be used in so many ways. You can ask it basic questions or some more difficult ones.</p>
